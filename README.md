# CMJ-1226

The Inequality for Arithmetic and Geometric Means, also known as the AM-GM Inequality, states that for a list of positive real numbers, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean. This theorem produces powerful results and will play a pivotal role in proving the Inequality posed in problem 1226 in the Mathematical Association of America Journal.
